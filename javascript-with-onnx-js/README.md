## Run PyTorch models in the browser using ONNX.js

Run PyTorch models in the browser with JavaScript by first converting your PyTorch model into the ONNX format and then loading that ONNX model in your website or app using ONNX.js. In the video tutorial below, I take you through this process using the demo example of a handwritten digit recognition model trained on the MNIST dataset.

### Live Demo and Code Sandbox

* [Live demo](https://vgzep.csb.app/)

* [Code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/pytorch-to-javascript-with-onnx-vgzep)

Note: The model used in this demo is not very accurate, it will often
[misclassify
digits](https://github.com/elliotwaite/pytorch-to-javascript-with-onnx-js/issues/1).
It's only meant to be used as a proof of concept. It's the same model that was
used in [PyTorch's MNIST
example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/blob/main/mnist/main.py).
You can find more accurate image classification models here: [Papers With Code -
Image Classification](https://paperswithcode.com/task/image-classification)

### The benefits of running a model in the browser:
* Faster inference times with smaller models.
* Easy to host and scale (only static files).
* Offline support.
* User privacy (can keep the data on the device).

### The benefits of using a backend server:
* Faster load times (don't have to download the model).
* Faster and consistent inference times with larger models (can take advantage of GPUs or other accelerators).
* Model privacy (don't have to share your model if you want to keep it private).
